Project works with CycleGAN and Pix2Pix trained models via official Tensorflow implementation. To change used model switch models\model1\model1 file to a different model. Keep the same name. For CycleGAN models uncomment "#FOR CYCLEGAN" block of code in 'image_prediction.py' file, comment "FOR PIX2PIX" and vice versa.
